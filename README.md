# rock-paper-scissor

the rock paper scissor game using the conditional statements in python along with the use of the loops (while loop)

first user gets the chance to pick anyone of them from the following options such as rock ,paper or scissor 
..later the computer chooses something randomly and then if both are equal its tie else the scissor cuts the paper , rock breaks the scissor 
the player or user can continue to play the game till he press N 

you can run the program in any ide u just need to type the filename.py to run the program or in the ide such as vscode ,pycharm u can run it directly by pressing the run button
